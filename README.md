# ThreeBody-LoRa-Qwen

An innovative project leveraging LoRa fine-tuning on the Qwen model to simulate Dr. Luo Ji from Liu Cixin's "The Three-Body Problem", exploring cosmic sociology and complex human-alien interactions.

## Project Description

This repository contains the code and dataset for the project that aims to use the LoRa fine-tuning technique on the Qwen model to simulate the character Dr. Luo Ji from the acclaimed science fiction novel "The Three-Body Problem". The purpose of this simulation is to explore themes of cosmic sociology and the potential scenarios of human and alien interactions within a controlled environment.

## Features

- Data extraction from "The Three-Body Problem"
- Implementation of LoRa fine-tuning on Qwen model
- Simulation scripts to model interactions as per Dr. Luo Ji's characteristics

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ThreeBody-LoRa-Qwen.git
cd ThreeBody-LoRa-Qwen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start a simulation, run the following command:

```bash
python simulate.py
```

## How It Works

Describe the methodology and the technical details of the implementation. Explain how LoRa fine-tuning is applied to the Qwen model and how the character simulation is achieved.
